**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete

---

## Overview

Implemented a two-phase approach to merchant support:
- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Simple contact form with Formspree - ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2 (Post-Launch):** In-app support widget with ticketing - Scheduled for Week 9-10

---

## Phase 1: Simple Contact Form (COMPLETE)

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Contact Page (`/contact`)
**File:** `app/contact/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Clean, responsive contact form
- Required fields: Name, Email, Subject, Message
- Optional field: Organization ID (for logged-in users)
- Success/error state handling
- Additional contact methods (email, help center)

**Form Fields:**
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Subject (required)
- Organization ID (optional - helps support identify the account)
- Message (required, multi-line)

#### 2. Formspree Integration
**Endpoint:** `https://formspree.io/f/xqayggka`

**Benefits:**
- No backend API needed
- Instant email notifications to support team
- Spam protection built-in
- Form submissions stored in Formspree dashboard
- Free tier supports 50 submissions/month

#### 3. Dashboard Integration
**Location:** Dashboard header (all dashboard pages)
**Link:** "Support" link added to top navigation (line 41-43 in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Access:**
- Logged-in users: Click "Support" in dashboard header
- Public users: Navigate to `/contact` directly

---

## User Experience

### For Merchants:
1. Click "Support" in dashboard header OR navigate to `/contact`
2. Fill out form (name, email, subject, message, optional org ID)
3. Submit form
4. See success message: "Thank you for contacting us. We'll get back to you within 24 hours."
5. Option to send another message

### For Support Team:
1. Receive email notification via Formspree
2. Email contains all form fields including org ID if provided
3. Respond directly via email
4. Access Formspree dashboard to see all submissions

---

## Response Time Commitment

**Displayed on Contact Page:**
> "We typically respond within 24 hours"

This sets clear expectations for merchants.

## Phase 2: In-App Support Widget (PLANNED)

### Scheduled For: Week 9-10 (Post-Launch)

### Planned Features:

#### 1. Support Tickets Database
```sql
create table public.support_tickets (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  org_id uuid references public.organizations (id),
  user_id uuid references auth.users (id),
  subject text not null,
  message text not null,
  status text not null check (status in ('open', 'in_progress', 'closed')),
  priority text not null check (priority in ('low', 'normal', 'high', 'urgent')) default 'normal',
  category text check (category in ('technical', 'billing', 'feature_request', 'bug', 'other')),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  closed_at timestamptz
);

create table public.support_messages (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  ticket_id uuid not null references public.support_tickets (id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid references auth.users (id), -- null if from support team
  message text not null,
  is_internal_note boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
```

#### 2. In-Dashboard Support Widget
- Help icon/button in dashboard header
- Slide-out panel or modal
- Auto-populated user info (name, email, org_id)
- Ticket submission form with categories
- View existing tickets and their status
- Real-time updates on ticket status

#### 3. Support Admin Panel
- `/admin/support` page for support team
- List all tickets with filters (status, priority, date)
- Ticket detail view with full conversation
- Internal notes (not visible to customer)
- Status management (open → in_progress → closed)
- Priority assignment
- Canned responses for common questions

#### 4. Email Notifications
- Customer receives email when:
  - Ticket is created (confirmation)
  - Support responds to ticket
  - Ticket is closed
- Support team receives email when:
  - New ticket is created
  - Customer responds to existing ticket

#### 5. Knowledge Base Integration (Optional)
- Searchable help articles
- "Common Issues" section
- Before creating ticket, suggest relevant articles
- Reduce support burden with self-service

## Alternative: Third-Party Solutions

If in-house support widget becomes too complex, consider:

### Option A: Intercom ($74/mo)
- Live chat + email support
- User context automatically passed
- Mobile apps included
- Knowledge base included
- Automated responses

### Option B: Crisp ($25/mo)
- Live chat + email support
- Cheaper than Intercom
- Good for small teams
- Knowledge base available

### Option C: Plain.com (Free tier available)
- Built for technical products
- Beautiful UI
- Email-based ticketing
- Linear/GitHub integration

## Current Limitations & Mitigation

### Current System (Formspree):

**Limitations:**
1. No ticket tracking (merchants can't see status)
2. No conversation threading (each submission is separate)
3. Limited analytics (Formspree dashboard only)
4. 50 submissions/month limit on free tier
5. No in-app notifications

**Mitigation:**
1. Fast response time (< 24 hours) reduces need for status updates
2. Include ticket reference in email subject when replying
3. Upgrade to Formspree Gold ($10/mo) for 1,000 submissions if needed
4. Phase 2 implementation planned for post-launch

## Documentation for Support Team

### How to Respond to Contact Form Submissions:

1. **Check Formspree Email Notification**
   - Subject will contain the merchant's subject line
   - Body contains all form fields
   - Note the Organization ID if provided

2. **Look Up Merchant Account (if org ID provided)**
   - Log into Supabase dashboard
   - Query: `SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE id = '[org_id]'`
   - Check related invoices, payments, Stripe status

3. **Respond via Email**
   - Reply directly to the Formspree notification
   - Use format: `Re: [Original Subject] - Ticket #[date]`
   - Be friendly, professional, concise
   - Provide clear next steps or solutions

4. **Common Issues & Responses**
   - **Stripe Connect issues:** Guide through onboarding steps, check Stripe dashboard
   - **Payment not received:** Check webhook logs, verify Stripe Connect status
   - **Invoice not sending:** Verify Resend API key configured, check email deliverability
   - **Can't log in:** Verify magic link not expired, check spam folder

5. **Escalation**
   - Critical bugs: Notify dev team immediately
   - Feature requests: Log in project management tool
   - Billing issues: CC finance/admin team

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 20-21):
- [x] Contact form implementation
- [x] Update work plan with Phase 2
- [x] Add "Support" link to dashboard
- [ ] Test form submission end-to-end

- [ ] Implement support ticket API routes
- [ ] Build support admin panel
- [ ] Set up email notifications for tickets

- No backend infrastructure needed
- Email delivery via Formspree

### Phase 1 (If scaling needed): $10/month
- Formspree Gold: 1,000 submissions/month
- Priority support from Formspree

### Phase 2 (In-house): ~$0/month
- Using existing Supabase database
- Using existing Resend email service

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 is complete and functional.** Merchants can now contact support via:
1. `/contact` page (public)
2. "Support" link in dashboard (logged-in users)
3. Direct email to `support@bildout.com`

**Phase 2 is planned for Week 9-10** (post-launch) and will provide a more robust ticketing system with conversation threading, status tracking, and in-app notifications.

This two-phase approach balances immediate needs (MVP launch) with future scalability (post-launch growth).
