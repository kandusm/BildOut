# Subscription Feature Gates Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Subscription feature gates have been successfully implemented to enforce plan limits for Free, Pro, and Agency tiers. The system now prevents users from exceeding their subscription limits and provides clear upgrade prompts.

---

## Files Created

### 1. `lib/subscription/check-limits.ts`
Central helper functions for checking subscription limits.

**Functions:**
- `checkInvoiceLimit(orgId)` - Checks if org can create more invoices
- `checkClientLimit(orgId)` - Checks if org can create more clients
- `checkFeatureAccess(orgId, feature)` - Checks if org can access a feature

**Return Format:**
```typescript
{
  allowed: boolean,
  limit: number | null,  // null = unlimited
  current: number,
  plan: 'free' | 'pro' | 'agency'
}
```

---

## Files Modified

### 2. `app/api/invoices/route.ts`
Added invoice limit enforcement.

**Changes:**
- Import `checkInvoiceLimit` helper
- Check limit before creating invoice
- Return 403 with upgrade message if limit reached

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invoice limit reached",
  "message": "You've reached your plan's limit of 10 invoices per month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices.",
  "limit": 10,
  "current": 10,
  "plan": "free",
  "upgradeRequired": true
}
```

### 3. `app/api/clients/route.ts`
Added client limit enforcement.

**Changes:**
- Import `checkClientLimit` helper
- Check limit before creating client
- Return 403 with upgrade message if limit reached

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Client limit reached",
  "message": "You've reached your plan's limit of 5 clients. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited clients.",
  "limit": 5,
  "current": 5,
  "plan": "free",
  "upgradeRequired": true
}
```

## How It Works

### Invoice Limit Check
1. User attempts to create an invoice via POST /api/invoices
2. System fetches organization's subscription plan
3. System counts invoices created this month (since 1st of month)
4. Compares current count vs. plan limit
5. If limit reached: Returns 403 error with upgrade prompt
6. If under limit: Proceeds with invoice creation

### Client Limit Check
1. User attempts to create a client via POST /api/clients
2. System fetches organization's subscription plan
3. System counts total non-deleted clients
4. Compares current count vs. plan limit
5. If limit reached: Returns 403 error with upgrade prompt
6. If under limit: Proceeds with client creation

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Free Plan Invoice Limit
- [ ] Create 10 invoices successfully
- [ ] 11th invoice should fail with proper error message
- [ ] Error response includes upgrade prompt
- [ ] Limit resets on 1st of next month

#### Free Plan Client Limit
- [ ] Create 5 clients successfully
- [ ] 6th client should fail with proper error message
- [ ] Error response includes upgrade prompt

#### Pro Plan (Unlimited)
- [ ] Can create > 10 invoices
- [ ] Can create > 5 clients
- [ ] No limits enforced

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Free user hits invoice limit**
1. Create org on Free plan
2. Create 10 invoices
3. Attempt to create 11th invoice
4. Expected: 403 error with upgrade message

**Scenario 2: Free user hits client limit**
1. Create org on Free plan
2. Create 5 clients
3. Attempt to create 6th client
4. Expected: 403 error with upgrade message

**Scenario 3: User upgrades to Pro**
1. Create org on Free plan with 10 invoices
2. Upgrade to Pro plan via Stripe
3. Attempt to create 11th invoice
4. Expected: Success (no more limits)

## Frontend Integration (To Be Implemented)

### Recommended UI Enhancements

1. **Invoice List Page**
   - Show usage counter: "9 / 10 invoices used this month"
   - Show upgrade banner when approaching limit
   - Disable "New Invoice" button when limit reached

2. **Client List Page**
   - Show usage counter: "4 / 5 clients"
   - Show upgrade banner when approaching limit
   - Disable "Add Client" button when limit reached

3. **Error Handling**
   - Catch 403 errors from API
   - Show modal with upgrade prompt
   - Link directly to /dashboard/settings/subscription

4. **Dashboard Widget**
   - Show subscription status card
   - Display usage meters for limits
   - "Upgrade" CTA button for Free plans

### Example Frontend Code

```typescript
// In invoice creation form
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/invoices', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(invoiceData),
  })

  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json()

    if (error.upgradeRequired) {
      // Show upgrade modal
      showUpgradeModal({
        title: 'Invoice Limit Reached',
        message: error.message,
        plan: error.plan,
        limit: error.limit,
        current: error.current,
      })
      return
    }

    throw new Error(error.message)
  }

  const invoice = await response.json()
  // Success handling...
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling...
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Feature Gates to Implement

1. **Custom Branding** (Pro+)
   - Check in: `/app/dashboard/settings/branding/page.tsx`
   - Block logo upload for Free users
   - Block color customization for Free users

2. **Email Reminders** (Pro+)
   - Check in: `/app/api/cron/overdue/route.ts`
   - Skip sending reminders for Free plan users

3. **Analytics** (Pro+)
   - Check in: `/app/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx`
   - Show upgrade prompt for Free users

4. **Data Export** (Pro+)
   - Check in: `/app/api/analytics/export/route.ts`
   - Block CSV export for Free users

5. **Team Members** (Based on plan limit)
   - Check when inviting team members
   - Free: 1, Pro: 3, Agency: Unlimited

### Usage Tracking

Consider adding a usage tracking table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE usage_tracking (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  org_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  metric_type TEXT, -- 'invoices', 'clients', 'emails_sent'
  count INTEGER,
  period_start TIMESTAMPTZ,
  period_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This would allow for:
- Historical usage analytics
- Faster limit checks (no need to count every time)
- Usage-based billing in the future

## API Documentation

### POST /api/invoices

**Rate Limiting:** Based on subscription plan
**Free Plan:** 10 invoices per month

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "number": "00001",
  "status": "draft",
  ...
}
```

**Error Response (403 - Limit Reached):**
```json
{
  "error": "Invoice limit reached",
  "message": "You've reached your plan's limit of 10 invoices per month. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices.",
  "limit": 10,
  "current": 10,
  "plan": "free",
  "upgradeRequired": true
}
```

### POST /api/clients

**Rate Limiting:** Based on subscription plan
**Free Plan:** 5 clients total

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Client Name",
  ...
}
```

**Error Response (403 - Limit Reached):**
```json
{
  "error": "Client limit reached",
  "message": "You've reached your plan's limit of 5 clients. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited clients.",
  "limit": 5,
  "current": 5,
  "plan": "free",
  "upgradeRequired": true
}
```

---

## Configuration

All subscription limits are defined in `lib/subscription-config.ts`:

```typescript
export const PLANS: Record<SubscriptionPlan, PlanFeatures> = {
  free: {
    features: {
      invoiceLimit: 10,
      clientLimit: 5,
      customBranding: false,
      emailReminders: false,
      analytics: false,
      exportData: false,
      // ...
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

To modify limits, update the configuration file and redeploy.

---

## Security Considerations

✅ **Server-side enforcement:** All checks happen on the API routes
✅ **Cannot be bypassed:** Frontend UI enhancements are optional - limits enforced at API level
✅ **Org-scoped:** Limits checked per organization, not per user
✅ **Monthly reset:** Invoice limits reset on 1st of each month
✅ **Real-time counts:** Always checks current database counts (not cached)

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Test all limit scenarios manually
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Confirm Pro users have unlimited access
- [ ] Test month rollover for invoice limits
- [ ] Add frontend UI for usage display
- [ ] Add upgrade modals/prompts
- [ ] Document API responses for frontend team
- [ ] Set up monitoring/alerts for limit-reached errors

---

## Support

For issues or questions about feature gates:
1. Check error responses for details
2. Verify org's subscription_plan in database
3. Test limits with different plans
4. Review logs for limit check failures
