### 5. ‚úÖ Webhook Signature Verification (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Properly implemented with critical bug fix

**Actions Taken:**
- Reviewed webhook signature verification code
- Verified idempotency mechanism
- **FIXED CRITICAL BUG:** Changed webhook to use service role client

**Bug Found & Fixed:**
- **Issue:** Webhook was using `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server` which has RLS enabled
- **Impact:** Webhooks would fail to update invoices/payments due to RLS restrictions
- **Fix:** Changed all webhook handlers to use service role client with `createSupabaseClient()`
- **Files Modified:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Security Measures Verified:**
- ‚úÖ Stripe signature verification (line 24)
- ‚úÖ Idempotency via `stripe_events` table (lines 36-55)
- ‚úÖ Duplicate event detection (lines 49-52)
- ‚úÖ Service role access for database operations (lines 34-37, 97-100, 183-186, 203-206)

**Event Handlers:**
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.succeeded` - Creates payment record, updates invoice
- ‚úÖ `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Logs failed payment
- ‚úÖ `account.updated` - Syncs Stripe onboarding status

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (lines 1-210)

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Payment Flow Security (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Comprehensive validation in place

**Actions Taken:**
- Reviewed payment intent creation logic
- Verified amount validation
- Confirmed application fee calculation

**Security Measures:**
- ‚úÖ Amount > 0 validation
- ‚úÖ Amount ‚â§ amount_due validation
- ‚úÖ Deposit requirement enforcement
- ‚úÖ Invoice status validation
- ‚úÖ Stripe Connect account verification
- ‚úÖ 1.5% platform fee calculation

**Files Reviewed:**
- `app/api/payments/intent/route.ts` (lines 40-99)

---

### 7. ‚úÖ Cron Job Security (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Properly secured and functional

**Previous Work (Day 19):**
- Fixed Resend initialization
- Changed to service role client
- Implemented conditional email sending

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ Bearer token authentication
- ‚úÖ Service role database access
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of missing Resend API key

**Files Reviewed:**
- `app/api/cron/overdue/route.ts`

## Bugs Fixed

### Critical Bug #1: Webhook RLS Issue
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Component:** Stripe Webhook Handler
**File:** `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Problem:**
- Webhooks were using regular Supabase client with RLS enabled
- Would fail to update invoices and payments after successful payments
- No auth context available in webhook requests

**Solution:**
- Changed all webhook database operations to use service role client
- Modified lines 34-37, 97-100, 183-186, 203-206
- Import changed from `@/lib/supabase/server` to `@supabase/supabase-js`

**Impact:**
- Webhooks can now successfully process payments
- Invoice status updates work correctly
- Payment records created properly

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Query Performance
- ‚úÖ All critical query paths indexed
- ‚úÖ Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- ‚úÖ Partial indexes reduce storage and improve query speed
- ‚úÖ GIN indexes enable fast fuzzy search

### Expected Query Performance:
- Invoice list queries: < 50ms
- Payment page lookups: < 10ms (indexed on payment_link_token)
- Overdue detection: < 100ms (partial index on due_date + status)
- Webhook lookups: < 10ms (indexed on stripe_payment_intent)
